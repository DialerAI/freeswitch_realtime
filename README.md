# Collect & Push FreeSWITCH channels to Influxdb [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/areski/fs_channels_influxdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/areski/fs_channels_influxdb)


Collect and push channels information from [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.org/) Sqlite CoreDB to [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/).

Channels information are pushed in the form of:

  ```
  %ChannelSeries{fields: %ChannelSeries.Fields{value: 1},
  tags: %ChannelSeries.Tags{campaign_id: 1, host: "127.0.0.1"}, timestamp: nil}
  ```

If you wish to use this with an other project you might want to remove `campaign_id` which is specific to [Newfies-Dialer](https://www.newfies-dialer.org/).


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `fs_channels` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:fs_channels, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `fs_channels` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:fs_channels]]
    end
    ```

  3. Add host in your `/etc/hosts` eg:

    ```
    127.0.0.1     influxdb_host
    ```

  4. Create directory for logs:

    ```
    mkdir /var/log/fs_channels
    ```


## Compile & Build Release

  1. Edit version in `mix.exs`


  2. Compile:

      MIX_ENV=prod mix compile


  3. Build release:

      MIX_ENV=prod mix release


  4. Build Deb package:

      MIX_ENV=prod mix release --deb


## Start on reboot

  Add fs_channels to `systemd` on Debian 8.x:

  ```
  cp fs_channels.service /lib/systemd/system/fs_channels.service
  systemctl enable fs_channels.service
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl restart fs_channels.service
  ```


## Todo

List of improvements and tasks,

- [ ] use [conform](https://github.com/bitwalker/conform) to support config file
